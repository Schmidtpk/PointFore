Title: Interpretation of point forecasts as state-dependent quantiles and expectiles
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Patrick", "Schmidt", email = "pschmidte@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimate specification models for the state-dependent level of an optimal quantile/expectile forecast.
  Wald Tests and the test of overidentifying restrictions are implemented. Ploting of the estimated specification model is possible.
  The package contains daily accumulated precipitation at London, UK from the high-resolution model of the
  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, <https://www.ecmwf.int/>).
  Based on "Interpretation of Point Forecasts" by Patrick Schmidt, Matthias Katzfuss, and Tilmann Gneiting.
