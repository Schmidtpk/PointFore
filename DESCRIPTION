Title: Interpretation of Point Forecasts as State-Dependent Quantiles and Expectiles
Version: 0.2.0.900
Authors@R: person("Patrick", "Schmidt", email = "pschmidte@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimate specification models for the state-dependent level of an optimal quantile/expectile forecast.
  Wald Tests and the test of overidentifying restrictions are implemented. Plotting of the estimated specification model is possible.
  The package contains two data sets with forecasts and realizations: the daily accumulated precipitation at London, UK from the high-resolution model of the
  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, <https://www.ecmwf.int/>) and GDP growth Greenbook data by the US Federal Reserve.
  Based on "Interpretation of Point Forecasts with unknown directive" by Patrick Schmidt, Matthias Katzfuss, and Tilmann Gneiting.
